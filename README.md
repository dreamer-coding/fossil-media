# **Fossil Media by Fossil Logic**

**Fossil Media** is a lightweight, portable data parsing and processing library written in pure C with zero external dependencies. Designed for maximum portability and flexibility, Fossil Media provides robust parsers and utilities to handle a variety of common and complex data formats including JSON, CSV, XML, and more. Its minimal footprint and clean, audit-friendly codebase make it ideal for embedded, cross-platform, and security-sensitive applications that require reliable data ingestion and transformation.

### Key Features

- **Wide Format Support**  
  Parse and process popular data formats such as JSON, CSV, XML, and extendable to custom formats.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Runs effortlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems without modification.

- **Zero External Dependencies**  
  Written entirely in clean, portable C to simplify integration and enable thorough code audits.

- **Efficient and Lightweight**  
  Optimized for minimal memory and CPU usage, making it perfect for resource-constrained environments.

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Easily customizable to support new data formats or tailor parsing behavior to your project‚Äôs needs.

- **Robust Data Handling**  
  Supports streaming parsing, validation, and conversion utilities for flexible data workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Meson Build System**  
  Fossil Media uses Meson for build configuration. If you don‚Äôt have Meson installed, please follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### Adding Fossil Media as a Dependency

#### Using Meson

### **Install or Upgrade Meson** (version 1.3 or newer recommended):

```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # Install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # Upgrade Meson
```
###	Add the .wrap File
Place a file named fossil-media.wrap in your subprojects directory with the following content:

```ini
# ======================
# Git Wrap package definition
# ======================
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-media.git
revision = v0.1.0

[provide]
fossil-media = fossil_media_dep
```

###	Integrate in Your meson.build
Add the dependency by including this line:

```meson
media_dep = dependency('fossil-media')
```


## Build Configuration Options

Customize your build with the following Meson options:
	‚Ä¢	Enable Tests
To run the built-in test suite, configure Meson with:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

### Tests Double as Samples

The project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to use these libraries through test cases.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to test Meson.  
In the same way, Fossil Logic validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests via Fossil Test.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
