# **Fossil Media by Fossil Logic**

**Fossil Media** is a lightweight, portable data parsing and processing library written in pure C with zero external dependencies. Designed for maximum portability and flexibility, Fossil Media provides robust parsers and utilities to handle a variety of common and complex data formats including JSON, CSV, XML, and more. Its minimal footprint and clean, audit-friendly codebase make it ideal for embedded, cross-platform, and security-sensitive applications that require reliable data ingestion and transformation.

### Key Features

- **Wide Format Support**  
  Parse and process popular data formats such as JSON, CSV, XML, and extendable to custom formats.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Runs effortlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems without modification.

- **Zero External Dependencies**  
  Written entirely in clean, portable C to simplify integration and enable thorough code audits.

- **Efficient and Lightweight**  
  Optimized for minimal memory and CPU usage, making it perfect for resource-constrained environments.

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Easily customizable to support new data formats or tailor parsing behavior to your project‚Äôs needs.

- **Robust Data Handling**  
  Supports streaming parsing, validation, and conversion utilities for flexible data workflows.

## Getting Started

## ***Prerequisites***

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you don‚Äôt have Meson `1.8.0 º or newer installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).
- **Conan Package Manager**: If you prefer using Conan, ensure it is installed by following the instructions on the official [Conan website](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Adding Dependency

#### Adding via Meson WrapDB

Meson can install packages directly from the WrapDB just like so, newest versions by default.

```bash
meson wrap install fossil-media
```

#### Adding via Conan GitHub repository

Conan can install packages directly from a GitHub repository if it contains a valid conanfile.py.

```bash
conan install git+https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-media.git#v0.1.1 --name fossil_media --build=missing
```

#### Adding via Conan Center Index
    
Conan can install packages directly from the Conan Center Index if it contains a valid conanfile.py.

```bash
conan install --require= fossil_media/0.1.1
```

#### Integrate the Dependency:
   
In your `meson.build` file, integrat by adding the following line:

```meson
dep = dependency('fossil-media')
```

**Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest release. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-media/releases) page for the latest versions.

## Build Configuration Options

Customize your build with the following Meson options:
	‚Ä¢	Enable Tests
To run the built-in test suite, configure Meson with:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

### Tests Double as Samples

The project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to use these libraries through test cases.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to test Meson.  
In the same way, Fossil Logic validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests via Fossil Test.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
